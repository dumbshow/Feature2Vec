 """Function used for producing batches of word-property co-occurrences using negative sampling 
            for training with an embedding model. Needs positive couples and labels first 
        
        Parameters
        ----------

        positive_couples : list of tuples
                A list of tuples which contain positive instances of word pairs. E.g ('apple', 'is_edible')
                
        positive_labels : list of ints (1)
            The response variable, and since these are positive cases then they are all ones 

        positive_sample_weights: list of ints
            list of frequency counts for each positive_couple used to weight the binary crossentropy 
            loss of different training instances
            
        negative_samples : int
            The number of negative samples to generate per positive instance
            
        shuffle : boolean 
            Whether to shuffle data or not 
            
        seed : int 
            Random seed for shuffling. If None then random seed is used
